# Ephemere

> Open a secure line

End-to-end encrypted and ephemeral instant messaging app, where messages are
never stored server-side and only resides within the user's app.

Built using the following open-source projects:

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)
- [Socket-io](https://socket.io)
- [TweetNaCl.js](https://tweetnacl.js.org)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project

```
